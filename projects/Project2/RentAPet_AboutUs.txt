<h2>In the Beginning ...</h2>
<p>Rent A Pet began with a family that loved dogs. George Smith and his wife Carol owned two Irish Setters. These dogs were pets to the Smith family children and extended family members.</p>
<p>One day as George was walking his dogs in the park, he noticed how they attracted the attention of passing women. They liked to stop and ask him about his dogs.</p>
<p>A young woman remarked that she would love to have a big dog like that to walk, but she had a small apartment and couldn't keep one. This brief encounter was the beginning of an idea.</p>
<p>What if there were others who wanted the companionship of pets without the responsibility? Maybe people would be willing to rent a pet for a short period of time.</p>

<h2 id="today">Where We Are Today</h2>
<p>After weighing these points, the Smiths decided to go ahead by starting small. In the fall of 1980, they started Rent A Pet. The business offered companionship of a pet without the expense or hassle of ownership.</p>
<p>They began by only renting dogs. Since then, Rent A Pet has added cats, horses, pigs, and snakes to their offerings.</p>

<h2 id="unique">What Makes Us Unique</h2>
<p>Rent A Pet has grown from its original Provo location and now has franchises in Logan, Bountiful, Salt Lake City, and St. George.</p>
<p>They employ their own trained vet and have never had an accident due to their rental pets. They also employ an animal trainer who works with the dogs and horses daily.</p>
<p>The company serves senior citizens in retirement homes where pets are not allowed, offering them companionship for the day.</p>
<p>Young men sometimes rent dogs to meet people while jogging or playing Frisbee. Trick dogs are rented for parties, movies, or commercials. Snakes are often rented for Halloween and other shock-value events.</p>
