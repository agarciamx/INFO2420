  <h2>Bessie Anderson - Senior Community Resident</h2>
  <p>My name is Bessie Anderson and I currently live in a retirement community that prohibits pets. I really wanted a small dog to take for walks, but thought it was impossible.</p>
  <p>Then I heard about Rent A Pet and was excited to try. I found a lovable basset hound named Sophie who was delivered to my apartment one Saturday morning.</p>
  <p>We went on a long walk in the nearby park and had a wonderful time. The Rent A Pet staff picked her up two hours later. I didn’t have to worry about feeding or watering Sophie.</p>
  <p>We now have a regular appointment every Saturday, weather permitting. I look forward to my weekly walk in the park, and I imagine Sophie does too.</p>
  <p>Thanks for giving me something to look forward to each week.<br>Yours,<br>Bessie Anderson</p>

  <h2>Jason Hutchingson - College Student</h2>
  <p>I'm a single college guy living in an apartment with three roommates. I always wanted a large dog to run with and play catch in the park.</p>
  <p>With Rent A Pet, I found Kazi, a German Shepherd who loves running in summer and cross-country skiing in winter. Kazi also loves Frisbee and obstacle courses.</p>
  <p>I attract attention from girls in the park when we go out, and I even met my fiancée, Janice, during a game of keep away with Kazi.</p>
  <p>One day, I hope to have a home with a yard for my own dog. Until then, I enjoy the companionship of Rent A Pet.</p>
  <p>Thanks to Rent A Pet,<br>Jason Hutchingson</p>

  <h2>Michael Pinette - Frequent Traveler and Exotic Pet Enthusiast</h2>
  <p>My business requires frequent travel, making it hard to own a pet. I’d have to find pet sitters or pay for boarding.</p>
  <p>I also like to surprise friends with unusual pets. Rent A Pet is perfect for my lifestyle.</p>
  <p>I’ve rented a snake, Saint Bernard, pot belly pig, and iguana. Since I can’t keep a houseplant alive, this lets me have fun without worrying about pet care.</p>
  <p>Thanks for adding spice to my life.<br>Michael Pinette, Alpine</p>
